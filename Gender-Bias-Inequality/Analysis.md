# Impact of Gender Bias and Inequality in Occupation

## Key Findings

* The analysis starts with understanding education level distribution pursued by different genders, where the data shows 
more females dominate males in pursuit of education, more specifically undergraduate and diploma degrees and are toe to toe in 
post-graduation qualification.

* Another insight is that these education levels are closely pictured on the occupation by gender, where males tend to occupy jobs 
with specific skills such as technicians, machine operators, etc.

* From labor work status data, it can be observed that males have a better working retention time, so they have better career 
advancement and more opportunities to achieve better income positions.

* These are proved from occupation by gender, where significantly more males are becoming managers, and from the income distribution,
it’s clear that more than 50% of males have a high weekly income of > $800.

* In the case of females, it is clear from the charts that there is a gender wage gap where most females have much lower weekly 
income when compared to males.

* Females over 25 start to withdraw from the workforce probably because of marriage and need more time to focus their 
attention on the family. Due to family responsibilities, they prefer not working at all or working part-time which results 
in low income. As females stay away from work for a certain period, their career progression is hampered by this, and hence, 
they find it challenging to secure a high-income job.

## Conclusions

* From the income, labor force status, education,
and occupation analysis, it can be seen that the driving force of the current economy is generally
generated by the male population especially, the ones with high weekly income.

* There is a wage gap
between males and females due to gender discrimination, lack of flexibility of workplace, parental
leave by the female worker, and spending more time out of the workforce.

* Female populations also
have unique preferences and needs, especially those aged 25 and over, where they withdraw from
the workforce due to family responsibility. It is great to see that they are pursuing other flexible jobs
or part-time jobs, which allow them to contribute to Australia’s economy.

## Recommendations

* I think the government and policymakers, in general, should take a look at creating more flexible jobs or jobs that can 
allow the female population to work full-time from home as well as incentives for firms to employ women, as they have better education background.

* The government should also look at minimizing the work environment insecurity that includes unfair pay, irregular working hours, and
access to paid leaves.

* It should also be made sure that in all the occupations, females should be given equal opportunities to progress to leadership roles 
like managers.

* Females mostly find it hard to work full-time once they are married and have a family. Working from home can help them support
their family and work full-time to fulfill their dreams at the same time.

* In addition to that, men should be allowed to take parental leave of at least 2-3 months which can help close the gender gap.
